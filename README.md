# Piano SVG Collection



A collection of SVG files illustrating piano chords, chord progressions, and music theory concepts. This repository serves as a visual reference for musicians learning piano theory and chord structures.

# motivation
a) I'm learning piano and I want to visualize the chords and chord progressions

b) it was fun to make :)

## Contents

### Individual Chords
